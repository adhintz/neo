Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge use a Mini50 unsealed 12-circuit (12CKT) Molex connector.
The Vertical Header (VHDR) is the part that the car's canbus connects to. It's this part: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/molex-llc/0348250124/WM10326-ND/4504599
with this set of dimentions: https://www.molex.com/pdm_docs/sd/348250124_sd.pdf

Going to the stock-LKAS camera is a receptacle (CONN RCPT) which has the same dimensions as the vertical header.
This is the receptacle: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/molex-llc/0348240124/WM10324-ND/4504597
and you'll need these crimp terminals to put wires (or headers) into the receptacle: https://www.molex.com/molex/products/datasheet.jsp?part=active/5600230448_CRIMP_TERMINALS.xml

The work is based on a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid 2017, although others appear to be the same.

Here is the pin-out for the forward-facing camera as supplied by Mopar (Chrysler): http://connectors.dcctools.com/details.htm?id=203000
